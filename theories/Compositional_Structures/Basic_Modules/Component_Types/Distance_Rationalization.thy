  A distance rationalizing of a voting rule is its interpretation as a
  procedure that elects an uncontroversial winner if there is one, and
  otherwise elects the alternatives that are as close to becoming an
  uncontroversial winner as possible. Within general distance rationalization,
  a voting rule is characterized by a distance on profiles and a consensus
  class.
